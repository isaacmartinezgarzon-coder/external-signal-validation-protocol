# External Signal Validation Protocol

## 1. Hypothesis (H)
A statement that can be verified through an external observable response.

## 2. Action
The minimum action required to test the hypothesis.

## 3. Signal (S)
Any external observable response produced after the action.

## 4. Criteria (C)
A binary condition that determines whether the signal validates the hypothesis.

## 5. Evaluation
YES if S meets C within the defined time window.  
NO otherwise.

## 6. Iteration Rule
If evaluation is NO, iterate on H or C, never on the action.
